One of the most valuable things Iâ€™ve learned so far in this course is how to use Git and GitHub to manage and track changes in my projects. 
I now understand how version control works, how to commit changes, and how to collaborate with others through branches and pull requests. 
It has made me feel more confident and organized in my learning journey as I start building real-world projects.
